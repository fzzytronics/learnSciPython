    "\n",
    "1.  **ANSYS Fluent:** Version 2022 R2 or newer installed on your computer.\n",
    "2.  **Python:** Python 3.7 or later. The [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is highly recommended as it simplifies package management.\n",
    "3.  **Required Python Libraries:** You will need `ansys-fluent-core`, `pyvista`, and `matplotlib`. If you don't have them, you can install them by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",

    "## Part 1: The Physics Behind the Simulation - What is CFD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems involving fluid flows. In short, we use computers to solve the governing equations of fluid motion for a specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Governing Equations: Navier-Stokes\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of most CFD problems are the **Navier-Stokes equations**. These are a set of partial differential equations describing the motion of viscous fluid substances. They are built upon three fundamental principles of conservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Conservation of Mass:** Mass is never created or destroyed. For a fluid, this means that if flow enters a defined volume, it must also exit it (unless the density changes).\n",
    "*   **Conservation of Momentum:** This is Newton's Second Law (F=ma) for a fluid. It states that the rate of change of momentum of a fluid particle is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it (like pressure and friction).\n",
    "*   **Conservation of Energy:** Energy is never created or destroyed. This principle accounts for the transfer of heat and the work done on the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these equations by hand is only possible for very simple cases. CFD software like ANSYS Fluent solves them numerically over thousands or millions of small cells that make up the geometry of our problem."

    "## Part 2: The CFD Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical CFD simulation follows a standard workflow. We will automate this entire process using Python within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "    *   **Geometry:** Defining the physical shape of the problem (e.g., a pipe, a wing, a heat exchanger).\n",
    "    *   **Meshing:** Dividing the geometry into thousands or millions of smaller elements called \"cells\". The governing equations are solved on these cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Solving:**\n",
    "    *   **Setup:** Defining the physics of the problem (e.g., is the flow turbulent or smooth?), material properties (e.g., air, water), and boundary conditions (e.g., inlet velocity, outlet pressure).\n",
    "    *   **Solution:** The solver software iteratively calculates the solution for variables like velocity and pressure at each cell in the mesh until the solution is \"converged\" (meaning the solution is no longer changing significantly).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Post-processing:**\n",
    "    *   **Analysis & Visualization:** Examining the results through plots, contours, and vectors to understand the fluid's behavior and extract meaningful data."
