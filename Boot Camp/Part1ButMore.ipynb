    "**Welcome!** In the 'Bootcamp' notebook, you learned the basic syntax of Python. Now, we move to the next level: learning how to think like a programmer to solve engineering problems. This lesson focuses on **programming logic**â€”how to make decisions, repeat tasks, and structure data and functions effectively.\n",

    "**Objective:** To provide a comprehensive guide to the essential programming structures and techniques used to build engineering models and simulations in Python.\n",

    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Master **Control Flow** using `if`/`elif`/`else` statements to make decisions in your code.\n",
    "2.  Learn to automate repetitive tasks using **`for` loops**.\n",
    "3.  Gain proficiency with **data structures** (lists and dictionaries) for organizing complex engineering data.\n",
    "4.  Learn to write more powerful and flexible **functions** that can return multiple values and use default arguments.\n",
    "5.  Combine all these skills to build a fully interactive simulation of a batch reactor."
