    "**Welcome!** This lesson is the theoretical heart of everything we do. The laws of physics and chemistry that govern our processes are written in the language of mathematics. To build powerful simulations, we must first be fluent in this language. This notebook will build your intuition for the core concepts of calculus and differential equations from an engineering perspective.\n",

    "**Objective:** To develop a deep, practical understanding of derivatives, integrals, and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and how they are used to model the dynamics of engineering systems.\n",

    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the **derivative** as an instantaneous rate of change and learn to approximate it numerically.\n",
    "2.  Understand the **integral** as the accumulation of a quantity and learn to compute it numerically.\n",
    "3.  Grasp that an **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)** is a mathematical statement of the \"rules of change\" for a system.\n",
    "4.  Learn how a computer solves an ODE by starting with an initial condition and taking small steps.\n",
    "5.  Combine these concepts to build an interactive simulation of a dynamic physical system."
