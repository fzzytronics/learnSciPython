    "**Welcome!** This lesson is a deep dive into the chemical principles that are the heart and soul of chemical engineering. While a chemist studies reactions to understand them, an engineer studies reactions to control and scale them. This notebook will provide the essential chemical knowledge needed to build accurate and predictive models of chemical processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To provide a comprehensive, practical guide to the core concepts of stoichiometry, kinetics, and equilibrium, and to demonstrate how these principles are translated into the mathematical models used in process simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Master the use of **moles, molar mass, and concentration** as the language of chemical quantity.\n",
    "2.  Apply **stoichiometry** to determine the quantitative relationships between reactants and products.\n",
    "3.  Understand **reaction kinetics**, including the rate law, reaction order, and the temperature-dependent rate constant via the **Arrhenius Equation**.\n",
    "4.  Grasp the concept of **chemical equilibrium** and understand how it defines the ultimate limit of a reversible reaction.\n",
    "5.  Combine all these principles to simulate a reversible batch reaction and observe it dynamically approaching equilibrium."
