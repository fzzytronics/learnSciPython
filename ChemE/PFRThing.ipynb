    "# Reaction Engineering Lesson: Modeling a Gas-Phase Plug Flow Reactor (PFR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson provides a detailed walkthrough for designing and simulating a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) for a gas-phase reaction where the number of moles changes. This is a critical skill, as it requires coupling reaction kinetics with fluid mechanics (volumetric flow rate changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Derive the fundamental design equation for a PFR from a differential mole balance.\n",
    "2.  Understand why and how to account for changes in volumetric flow rate in gas-phase systems.\n",
    "3.  Develop a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that describes the molar flow rates of all species along the reactor length.\n",
    "4.  Solve this system of ODEs using Python's scientific libraries (`SciPy`).\n",
    "5.  Visualize and interpret the resulting concentration and conversion profiles."

    "## The PFR Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) models the behavior of a reactor where fluid flows as a series of infinitesimally thin 'plugs'. Each plug is a tiny batch reactor that moves down the length of the PFR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumptions:**\n",
    "*   **No Axial Mixing:** There is no mixing or diffusion in the direction of flow.\n",
    "*   **Perfect Radial Mixing:** Within any given plug (at a specific axial position), the concentration, temperature, and reaction rate are uniform.\n",
    "*   **Steady State:** The properties at any given point in the reactor do not change with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that reactant concentration is high at the inlet and gradually decreases as the fluid flows down the length of the reactor. Our goal is to model this profile.\n",

    "## Part 2: The Challenge - Gas-Phase Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of reaction, $r_A$, typically depends on **concentration**, $C_A$. For example, for a first-order reaction, $r_A = -k C_A$. The concentration is related to molar flow by:\n",
    "$$ C_A = \\frac{F_A}{v} $$\n",
    "where $v$ is the **volumetric flow rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In gas-phase reactions where the number of moles changes, $v$ is NOT constant!** As reactants turn into products, the total number of moles can increase or decrease, changing the volume of the gas (and thus the concentrations of all species).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can relate the change in volumetric flow to the change in total molar flow ($F_T$) using the ideal gas law (assuming isothermal and isobaric conditions):\n",
    "$$ v = v_0 \\left( \\frac{F_T}{F_{T0}} \\right) $$\n",
    "where $v_0$ and $F_{T0}$ are the initial volumetric and total molar flow rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Strategy:** We will write our ODEs in terms of molar flows ($F_i$) for every species. Inside our model function, at each step (each `dV`), we will:\n",
    "1.  Use the current molar flows ($F_i$) to calculate the total molar flow ($F_T$).\n",
    "2.  Use $F_T$ to calculate the current volumetric flow ($v$).\n",
    "3.  Use $F_i$ and $v$ to calculate current concentrations ($C_i$).\n",
    "4.  Use $C_i$ to calculate the reaction rate ($r_A$).\n",
    "5.  Use $r_A$ to calculate the derivatives ($dF_i/dV$) for the next step of the ODE solver."

    "*   **Molar Flow of Methane (Red):** The product is generated, so its molar flow increases from zero.\n",
    "*   **Rate of Reaction:** The slope of the DME curve is steepest at the beginning (V=0) and becomes shallower. This is because the reaction rate is highest at the inlet where the reactant concentration is highest.\n",

Can you add another ODE to the system, $\\frac{dP}{dV} = -f(\\text{flow properties})$, and use the changing pressure $P(V)$ in your calculation of volumetric flow $v$? \n",

You would need to modify the rate law to include a reverse term: $r_A = -k_f C_A + k_r C_B C_C C_D$. How would this change the final conversion profile? Would it still reach 100% if the reactor were infinitely long?"
