    "# Separations Processes: Designing a Distillation Column with McCabe-Thiele\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson provides a hands-on guide to designing a binary distillation column using the graphical McCabe-Thiele method. We will translate the graphical method into a computational algorithm to determine the number of theoretical stages required for a specific separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the core concepts of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) for binary systems.\n",
    "2.  Derive and understand the meaning of the Operating Lines (Rectifying and Stripping) and the Feed Line (q-line).\n",
    "3.  Construct a complete McCabe-Thiele diagram programmatically.\n",
    "4.  Implement an algorithm to \"step off\" the theoretical stages and find the optimal feed location.\n",
    "5.  Analyze how key design parameters, like the reflux ratio and feed condition, impact the column design."

    "## The Problem: Binary Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "Distillation is the most widely used separation technique in the chemical industry. It works by exploiting differences in **volatility** between components in a liquid mixture. We will design a column to separate a mixture of a more volatile component (MVC) and a less volatile component (LVC).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:** Given a feed stream with a certain composition ($z_F$) and thermal condition ($q$), we want to produce a high-purity **distillate** ($x_D$) rich in the MVC and a high-purity **bottoms** ($x_B$) rich in the LVC. Our task is to calculate the **number of theoretical stages** required to achieve this separation at a given **reflux ratio ($R$)**."

    "\n",
    "The foundation of the McCabe-Thiele method is the **equilibrium curve**, which plots the vapor mole fraction ($y$) versus the liquid mole fraction ($x$) for the more volatile component. For many ideal systems, this relationship can be described using a **constant relative volatility ($\\alpha$)**.\n",
    "$$ y = \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + (\\alpha - 1)x} $$\n",
    "A higher $\\alpha$ means the separation is easier. The equilibrium curve always lies above the $y=x$ line (also called the 45-degree line)."
