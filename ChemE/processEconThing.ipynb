    "# Process Economics Lesson: Optimizing a Distillation Column\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson demonstrates a core principle of engineering design: the trade-off between Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditure (OPEX). We will find the economically optimal design for a distillation column by varying the reflux ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the relationship between reflux ratio, number of stages, and reboiler duty.\n",
    "2.  Develop a simplified economic model for both CAPEX (column cost) and OPEX (energy cost).\n",
    "3.  Combine an engineering model (McCabe-Thiele) with an economic model.\n",
    "4.  Programmatically find the design point with the minimum Total Annualized Cost (TAC).\n",
    "5.  Visualize and interpret the cost trade-off curve."

    "In distillation design, the **reflux ratio ($R$)** is the primary decision variable that drives the economics:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Low Reflux Ratio (approaching $R_{min}$):**\n",
    "    *   **OPEX:** Low. The energy required for the reboiler is small.\n",
    "    *   **CAPEX:** High. An infinite number of stages are needed, making the column impossibly tall and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **High Reflux Ratio:**\n",
    "    *   **OPEX:** High. A large amount of vapor must be boiled up to be sent back as reflux, consuming a lot of energy.\n",
    "    *   **CAPEX:** Low. The number of stages required is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere between these two extremes lies an **optimal reflux ratio** that minimizes the **Total Annualized Cost (TAC)**."
