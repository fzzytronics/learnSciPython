    "# A Transport Phenomena Case Study: Heat Transfer in a Pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson will walk through a classic transport phenomena problem that combines fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and an overall energy balance. We will simulate the temperature profile of a fluid as it heats up while flowing through a hot-walled pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the interplay between Momentum Transport (fluid flow) and Heat Transport.\n",
    "2.  Apply key dimensionless numbers: Reynolds ($Re$), Prandtl ($Pr$), and Nusselt ($Nu$).\n",
    "3.  Calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient ($h$) using empirical correlations.\n",
    "4.  Develop a dynamic model based on a differential energy balance along the pipe.\n",
    "5.  Solve the resulting Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to find the temperature profile and validate it against the analytical solution."

    "First, we need to understand the nature of the fluid flow. Is it smooth and orderly (laminar) or chaotic and well-mixed (turbulent)? This is determined by the **Reynolds Number ($Re$)**, which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces.\n",
    "$$ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "*   $\\rho$ = fluid density (kg/m³)\n",

    "*   $D$ = pipe diameter (m)\n",
    "*   $\\mu$ = fluid viscosity (Pa·s)\n",

    "*   $Re < 2100$: Laminar Flow\n",
    "*   $Re > 4000$: Turbulent Flow\n",
