    "# Mass Transfer Lesson: Designing a Liquid-Liquid Extraction Cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson will guide you through the design of a multi-stage, counter-current liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) process. We will use a stage-by-stage calculation method, analogous to McCabe-Thiele, to determine the number of theoretical stages needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the principles of LLE and the role of the partition coefficient.\n",
    "2.  Derive and apply the operating line equation for a counter-current cascade.\n",
    "3.  Construct a graphical representation of the LLE process (an x-y diagram).\n",
    "4.  Implement a computational algorithm to step off the theoretical stages.\n",
    "5.  Analyze how changing the solvent-to-feed ratio impacts the separation."

    "We have a **feed** stream containing a valuable **solute (A)** dissolved in a **carrier (C)**. We want to extract the solute using a **solvent (S)** that is immiscible with the carrier. The solute-depleted carrier stream leaving is called the **raffinate**, and the solute-rich solvent stream leaving is called the **extract**.\n",

    "In a counter-current cascade, the feed enters at one end (Stage 1) and the solvent enters at the other (Stage N). This is the most efficient configuration.\n",

    "1.  **Solvent Flow Rate:** The ratio of solvent to feed is a key design parameter. **Increase the solvent flow rate `S` to `250.0` kg/hr.** Do you need more or fewer stages? What is the practical downside of using more solvent in a real plant (hint: think about having to process the extract stream later)?\n",
    "2.  **A Better Solvent:** Your R&D department finds a new solvent with a higher affinity for the solute, giving it a **Partition Coefficient `KD` of `8.0`.** How does this impact the number of stages required to achieve the same separation?\n",
    "3.  **Minimum Solvent Rate:** There is a minimum solvent rate below which the desired separation is impossible, no matter how many stages you have. This occurs when the operating line intersects the equilibrium line. Can you find this minimum solvent rate for the base case?"
