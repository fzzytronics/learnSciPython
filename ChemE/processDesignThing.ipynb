    "# Process Design & Simulation: Designing a Flash Drum Separator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson will guide you through a complete, albeit simplified, process design and simulation workflow. We will design a flash drum to separate a binary mixture of benzene and toluene, a classic chemical engineering problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the role of a flash drum in chemical processes.\n",
    "2.  Apply the principles of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE), including Raoult's Law and Antoine's Equation.\n",
    "3.  Formulate the material and energy balance equations (the \"Rachford-Rice\" equations) that govern the separation.\n",
    "4.  Use Python's scientific libraries (`NumPy`, `SciPy`) to solve the system of non-linear equations that describe the process.\n",
    "5.  Analyze and interpret the simulation results to evaluate the performance of our design."

    "## The Design Challenge: Flash Separation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a liquid feed stream containing a 50/50 mole mix of benzene and toluene at a high pressure. Our goal is to separate this mixture into a vapor stream enriched in the more volatile component (benzene) and a liquid stream enriched in the less volatile component (toluene).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **flash drum** is the perfect unit operation for this. The process works by taking the high-pressure liquid feed, passing it through a valve to drop the pressure, and feeding it into a large tank (the drum). The sudden pressure drop causes a portion of the liquid to instantly vaporize or \"flash\". Because the components have different volatilities, the vapor and liquid phases will have different compositions.\n",

    "**Our Task:** Given a feed stream and a desired operating pressure and temperature for the drum, we need to calculate:\n",
    "*   The fraction of the feed that vaporizes ($V/F$).\n",
    "*   The composition of the resulting vapor stream ($y_i$).\n",
    "*   The composition of the resulting liquid stream ($x_i$)."

    "## Part 1: The Physics - Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The separation is only possible because of VLE. For an ideal mixture (which benzene-toluene is a good approximation of), the VLE relationship is described by **Raoult's Law**:\n",
    "$$ y_i P = x_i P_i^{sat} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "*   $y_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the vapor phase.\n",
    "*   $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the liquid phase.\n",
    "*   $P$ is the total pressure of the system (the drum pressure).\n",

    "We can define an equilibrium constant, $K_i$:\n",
    "$$ K_i = \\frac{y_i}{x_i} = \\frac{P_i^{sat}}{P} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the vapor pressure, $P_i^{sat}$, we use the **Antoine Equation**, an empirical formula that relates vapor pressure to temperature:\n",

    "## Part 2: The Model - Rachford-Rice Flash Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for the unknowns in our flash drum, we need to solve a system of equations based on material balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "*   $F$ = Molar flow rate of the feed (we'll assume $F=1$ mol/s).\n",
    "*   $L$ = Molar flow rate of the liquid product.\n",
    "*   $V$ = Molar flow rate of the vapor product.\n",
    "*   $z_i$ = Mole fraction of component $i$ in the feed.\n",

    "**Overall Material Balance:**\n",
    "$$ F = L + V $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component Material Balance:**\n",
    "$$ F z_i = L x_i + V y_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these balances with the VLE relationship ($y_i = K_i x_i$), we can derive the famous **Rachford-Rice equation**:\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i} \\frac{z_i (K_i - 1)}{1 + \\psi (K_i - 1)} = 0 $$\n",
    "where $\\psi$ is the vapor fraction, $V/F$. This single, powerful equation allows us to solve for the fraction of the feed that vaporizes. We will solve this numerically."
