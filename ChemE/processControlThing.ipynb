    "**Objective:** This lesson demonstrates the critical relationship between process control and process safety. We will design a feedback control loop for a common process unit (a surge tank) and then analyze its performance and safety margins during a process upset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the components of a feedback control loop: Process Variable (PV), Setpoint (SP), and Manipulated Variable (MV).\n",
    "2.  Implement a dynamic model of a simple process (tank level).\n",
    "3.  Understand and code a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, the workhorse of the process industry.\n",
    "4.  Simulate the control system's response to a setpoint change and a disturbance.\n",
    "5.  Integrate a layer of safety by defining and visualizing process alarms."

    "### Interpreting the Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Response:** At the start, the controller sees the level is below the setpoint, so it reduces the outlet flow to allow the level to rise. It successfully brings the level to the setpoint of 3.0 m.\n",
    "2.  **Disturbance Rejection:** At t=20 minutes, the inlet flow suddenly increases. This is a process upset. The level begins to rise, pushing the PV away from the SP.\n",
    "3.  **Controller Action:** The PID controller immediately responds to this deviation. It opens the outlet valve (increases $F_{out}$) to counteract the extra inlet flow and drive the level back down towards the setpoint.\n",
    "4.  **Safety Analysis:** The most important observation from a safety perspective is that **the peak level during the upset remained below the High Alarm (LAH) limit.** This means our primary control loop successfully handled the disturbance without requiring operator intervention or an automated safety shutdown. The system is robust and safe for this particular upset."
