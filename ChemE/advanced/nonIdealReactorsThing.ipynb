    "# Non-Ideal Reactor Design with Residence Time Distribution (RTD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson delves into the analysis of non-ideal reactors. We will explore how real reactors deviate from ideal CSTR and PFR behavior and learn how to characterize this non-ideal flow using Residence Time Distribution (RTD). Ultimately, we will use this RTD data to predict the reactor's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the concepts of non-ideal flow, including dead zones and bypassing/channeling.\n",
    "2.  Learn how a tracer experiment is used to generate an RTD curve ($E(t)$).\n",
    "3.  Derive and plot the theoretical RTD curves for ideal PFR and CSTR reactors.\n",
    "4.  Model a non-ideal reactor using the **Tanks-in-Series (TIS)** model and see how it bridges the gap between CSTRs and PFRs.\n",
    "5.  Use the **Segregated Flow Model** to predict the conversion of a chemical reaction in a non-ideal reactor."

    "The CSTR and PFR models are mathematical ideals based on strict assumptions about mixing:\n",
    "*   **Ideal CSTR:** Assumes mixing is instantaneous and complete.\n",
    "*   **Ideal PFR:** Assumes no mixing in the axial direction, but perfect mixing radially.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, industrial reactors suffer from non-ideal flow patterns:\n",
    "*   **Dead Zones:** Regions of the reactor with very low flow, where fluid gets 'stuck'.\n",
    "*   **Bypassing or Channeling:** When fluid takes a short-cut from the inlet to the outlet, spending very little time in the reactor.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have successfully characterized a non-ideal reactor using the Tanks-in-Series model and used its RTD to predict a conversion that falls predictably between the ideal PFR and CSTR cases. This demonstrates the power of RTD analysis in providing a more realistic picture of reactor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Effect of Non-Ideality:** How does the predicted conversion change as you vary `N_non_ideal` from 2 up to 20? Create a plot of Conversion vs. N. What does this tell you about the importance of preventing back-mixing in reactor design?\n",
    "2.  **Effect of Reaction Order:** The Segregated Flow Model gives different results for different reaction orders. Modify the `batch_conversion` function for a **second-order reaction**, where $X_A(t) = \\frac{k C_{A0} t}{1 + k C_{A0} t}$. Re-calculate the conversions for the PFR, CSTR, and non-ideal reactor. Is the impact of non-ideality more or less severe for a second-order reaction?\n",
    "3.  **Mean Residence Time:** Use numerical integration (`quad`) to verify that the mean of the E-curve for the TIS model is indeed equal to $\\tau$. The integral you need to solve is $\\int_0^\\infty t \\cdot E(t) \\, dt$."
