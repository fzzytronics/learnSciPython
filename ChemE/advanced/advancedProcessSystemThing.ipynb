    "# Plant-wide Simulation: Solving a Reactor-Separator-Recycle Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This lesson demonstrates how to simulate a complete chemical process, moving beyond single unit operations. We will model a plant consisting of a reactor and a separator, connected by a critical **recycle stream**. We will implement an iterative algorithm to solve this loop and analyze the overall system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Understand the concept of a process flowsheet and system-level thinking.\n",
    "2.  Recognize why recycle streams introduce computational complexity and require an iterative solution.\n",
    "3.  Implement a simple Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) model and a component separator model.\n",
    "4.  Write a \"successive substitution\" algorithm to converge the recycle loop.\n",
    "5.  Analyze how separator performance and reactor conversion impact the overall process and the size of the recycle stream."

    "We will model a simplified process for the dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene (EB) to produce Styrene (ST) and Hydrogen (H2).\n",
    "$$ \\text{Ethylbenzene (EB)} \\rightarrow \\text{Styrene (ST)} + \\text{Hydrogen (H}_2\\text{)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plant flowsheet consists of three main parts:\n",
    "1.  **Mixer:** Fresh feed of pure EB is mixed with a recycle stream containing unreacted EB.\n",
    "2.  **PFR Reactor:** The combined feed enters the reactor where some of the EB is converted to ST and H2.\n",
    "3.  **Separator:** The reactor outlet is cooled and sent to a separator. We assume this unit perfectly separates the H2 as a gas product. It then separates a fraction of the ST as the main product, while the remaining ST and all unreacted EB form the recycle stream.\n",

    "## The Challenge: Solving the Recycle Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot solve this flowsheet sequentially. The input to the Mixer (and thus the Reactor) depends on the Recycle stream, but the Recycle stream depends on the output of the Separator, which in turn depends on the output of the Reactor. This creates a circular dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Iteration**\n",
    "We must use an iterative approach called **successive substitution**:\n",
    "1.  **Guess** the initial properties of the recycle stream (flow rates of each component).\n",
    "2.  Use this guess to calculate the Mixer and then the Reactor.\n",
    "3.  Calculate the Separator based on the reactor outlet.\n",
    "4.  This gives us a **new, calculated** recycle stream.\n",
    "5.  **Compare** the new recycle stream to our initial guess. If they are close enough (converged), we are done. If not, we use the newly calculated stream as our **next guess** and repeat from step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to \"tearing\" the recycle stream in a professional process simulator."
