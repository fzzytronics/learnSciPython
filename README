Hi, it's me, pablo

so I strongly recommend starting with the boot camp, then the stuff outside advanced, then advanced. 
PFR, CSTR, process design and control, those things. There's no real order to these.

You CAN run these on VScode and have the python code snippets on spyder, but it's STRONGLY recommended you run them in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab. 
The only ones that NEED to be ran in the jupyter environment are the Boot Camp stuff and advancedProcessSystemThing bc they have a widget avalible only in jupyter, so be aware. 

Reach out if there are any errors or anything through the github or if you have my socials through those.
Happy Hunting!
