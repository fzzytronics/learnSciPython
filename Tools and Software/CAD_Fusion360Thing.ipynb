    "\n",
    "**Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** is the use of computers to create, modify, analyze, and optimize 2D and 3D designs. In aerospace, nothing gets built without first being modeled in CAD. From the initial concept of a new jet to the detailed design of every single bracket and screw, CAD is the foundation of modern aircraft development.\n",

    "**Fusion 360** is a modern, cloud-based tool that integrates several stages of engineering into one platform: **CAD** (design), **CAM** (manufacturing), and **CAE** (simulation/engineering). This is the tool we will use today."
